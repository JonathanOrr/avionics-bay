This is a C++ support library for X-Plane 11 Lua plugins (working via FFI).

The library is in the early stage of development and it will offer:
- The asynchronous reading of X-Plane files (e.g., apt.dat and other files)
- Graphics-related support functions (such as polygon triangulation)


The library is currently developed to support the open source [A321Neo project](https://github.com/JonathanOrr/A321Neo-FXPL),
and the development is currently focused on the needs and integration with this project.
